I agree with Miroslav about using ftrace, or Dan in the other thread
about using gcov if even more granular coverage is needed.

Admittedly, I would have to go find documentation to remember how to do
either, but at least I'd be using well-tested facilities designed for
this exact purpose.

Adding these attributes to livepatch sysfs would be expedient and
probably easier for us to use, but imposes a recurring burden on us to
maintain and test (where is the documentation and kselftest for this new
interface?).  Or, we could let the other tools handle all of that for
us.

Perhaps if someone already has an off-the-shelf script that is using
ftrace to monitor livepatched code, it could be donated to
Documentation/livepatch/?  I can ask our QE folks if they have something
like this.
