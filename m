Good. Quick grep through the sources gave me a couple of hits, so I was 
not sure.

In a way yes, but as Masami described elsewhere in the thread there are 
more convenient ways to circumvent it even now. Not as convenient as 
kallsyms, of course.

Yes, I think it is on standby now. I thought about it while walking 
through Petr's module split patch set and it seemed to me that klp-convert 
could be made much much simpler on top of that. So we should start there.

Anyway, as far as Will's patch set is concerned, there is no real obstacle 
on our side, is there?

Alexei mentioned ksplice from git history, but no one cares about ksplice 
in upstream now, I would say.

Thanks
