Hi,

I have added people mentioned in commits which modified
cleanup_symbol_name() in kallsyms.c.

I think that stripping ".*" suffix does not work for static
variables defined locally from symbol does always work,
see below.

OK, so the ".llvm.<hash>" suffix is added when a symbol is promoted
from static to global. Right?

Hmm, how does kpatch match the fixed functions? They are modified
so that they should get different IR (hash). Or do I miss
anything, please?

And <function>.<symbol> notation seems to be used for static symbols
defined inside a function.

I guess that it is used when the symbols stay statics. It would
probably get additional ".llvm.<hash>" when it got promoted
from static to global. But this probably never happens.

Do I get it correctly?

It means that we have two different types of name changes:

  1. .llvm.<hash> suffix

     If we remove this suffix then we will not longer distinguish
     symbols which stayed static and which were promoted to global
     ones.

     The result should be basically the same as without LTO.
     Some symbols might have duplicated name. But most symbols
     would have an unique one.


  2. <function>.<symbol> name

     In this case, <symbol> is _not_ suffix. It is actually
     the original symbol name.

     The extra thing is the <function>. prefix.

     These static variables seem to have special handling even
     with gcc without LTO. gcc adds an extra id instead,
     for example:

	$> nm vmlinux | grep " _entry_ptr" | head
	ffffffff82a2e800 d _entry_ptr.100135
	ffffffff82a2e7f8 d _entry_ptr.100178
	ffffffff82a32e70 d _entry_ptr.100798
	ffffffff82a1e240 d _entry_ptr.10342
	ffffffff82a33930 d _entry_ptr.104764
	ffffffff82a339c8 d _entry_ptr.104830
	ffffffff82a33928 d _entry_ptr.104871
	ffffffff82a33920 d _entry_ptr.104877
	ffffffff82a33918 d _entry_ptr.104893
	ffffffff82a339c0 d _entry_ptr.104905

	$> nm vmlinux | grep panic_console_dropped
	ffffffff853618e0 b panic_console_dropped.54158


Effect from the tracers POV?

  1. .llvm.<hash> suffix

     The names without the .llvm.<hash> suffix are the same as without
     LTO. This is probably why commit 8b8e6b5d3b013b0b ("kallsyms: strip
     ThinLTO hashes from static functions") worked. The tracers probably
     wanted to access only the symbols with uniqueue names


  2. <function>.<symbol> name

     The name without the .<symbol> suffix is the same as the function
     name. The result are duplicated function names.

     I do not understand why this was not a problem for tracers.
     Note that this is pretty common. _entry and _entry_ptr are
     added into any function calling printk().

     It seems to be working only by chance. Maybe, the tracers always
     take the first matched symbol. And the function name, without
     any suffix, is always the first one in the sorted list.


Effect from livepatching POV:

  1. .llvm.<hash> suffix

      Comparing the full symbol name looks fragile to me because
      the <hash> might change.

      IMHO, it would be better to compare the names without
      the .llvm.<hash> suffix even for livepatches.


   2. <function>.<symbol> name

      The removal of <.symbol> suffix is a bad idea. The livepatch
      code is not able to distinguish the symbol of the <function>
      and static variables defined in this function.

      IMHO, it would be better to compare the full
       <function>.<symbol> name.


Result:

IMHO, cleanup_symbol_name() should remove only .llwn.* suffix.
And it should be used for both tracers and livepatching.

Does this makes any sense?

Petr
