I expect that the tracers access only symbols that are unique even
after removing the extra suffix.

Otherwise they would have the same problem even without suffix.
Each symbol create its own entry in kallsyms. There might be
more static symbols of the same name. This is why there is
"old_sympos" in struct klp_func. See also klp-convert,
https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230306140824.3858543-1-joe.lawrence@redhat.com

Fortunately, the same names are rare and "old_sympos" is used
only rarely. This is why it probably works for the tracers as well.

Good question. I primary tried to add more details so that
we better understand the problem.

Honestly, I do not know the answer. I am neither familiar with
kpatch nor with clang. Let me think loudly.

kpatch produce livepatches by comparing binaries of the original
and fixed kernel. It adds a symbol into the livepatch when
the same symbol has different code in the two binaries.

So one important question is how clang generates the suffix.
Is the suffix the same in every build? Is it the same even
after the function gets modified by a fix?

If the suffix is always the same then then the full symbol name
would be better for kpatch. kpatch would get it for free.
And kpatch would not longer need to use "old_sympos".

But if the suffix is different then kpatch has a problem.
kpatch would need to match symbols with different suffixes.
It would be easy for symbols which are unique after removing
the suffix. But it would be tricky for comparing symbols
which do not have an unique name. kpatch would need to find
which suffix in the original binary matches an other suffix
in the fixed binary. In this case, it might be easier
to use the stripped symbol names.

And the suffix might be problematic also for source based
livepatches. They define struct klp_func in sources so
they would need to hardcode the suffix there. It might
be easy to keep using the stripped name and "old_sympos".

I expect that this patch actually breaks the livepatch
selftests when the kernel is compiled with clang LTO.
