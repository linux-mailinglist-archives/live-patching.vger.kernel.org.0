Nice to meet you all.  Adding the live-patching ML sub-thread.

That would be great!

If this proprietary mechanism relies on stack traces, that could
problematic.  Livepatch originally made the same assumption, but it was
shot down quickly:

Yes, though it's generally agreed that unvalidated compiler-generated
unwinder metadata isn't going to be robust enough for kernel live
patching.

The "traps" are more about how the patches are generated.  If they're
built with source code, like a normal kernel module, you have to be
extra careful because of function ABI nastiness.  kpatch-build avoids
this problem.  Unfortunately this still isn't documented.

Right.  There are some good details in
Documentation/livepatch/livepatch.rst.

Yes, problematic areas are interrupts, exceptions, inline asm,
hand-coded asm.  A nice document was recently added in
Documentation/livepatch/reliable-stacktrace.rst which covers a lot of
this stuff.

Very impressive to run it in production that long.  Their experience and
expertise is definitely welcome.

Hopefully we can just forget the GCC plugin idea.

It would be really nice to see some performance numbers for
-fno-jump-tables so we can justify doing that instead, at least in the
short-term.  I'd suspect the difference isn't measurable in the real
world.

(In the case of GCC+retpolines, it would be a performance improvement.)

So basically you're saying objtool is both useful and well-designed.  I
will quote you on that!
